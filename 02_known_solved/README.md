The challenge provides the a decryptor for the files. Simple RE can be done to deduce the encryption algorithm.

Since simple XOR is used, we can easily deduce the key used, `No1Trust`. With the key, we can simply run the decryptor to automatically decrypt all files in the directory and get the flag.
