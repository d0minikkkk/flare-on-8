The binary uses exceptions to call WinAPIs. Trace `AddVectoredExceptionsHandler` to find the function that is responsible for resolving the APIs and calling them. The API calls are made via patching, and modifications of EIP.

Thread 4 is the main function to reverse. Within thread 4, there is 4 hex strings loaded into memory, and will be decrypted after passing checks in thread3. However, manual decryption of the strings can be done to reveal `L0ve`,`s3cret`,`5Ex` & `g0d`. These 4 strings are then passed into a crc32 function to form a key, to decrypt the ciphertext via ARC4.
